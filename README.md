# financial-data-analysis
Python project to play around with fetching financial data using Financial Modeling Prep API, and store it locally in a CSV/other sort of local DB (might provide option to connect with remote DB #headlessarchitecture, check readme), and do some analysis and visualization with the data. As of last update, running html bar chart on flask app, so you can view locally chart of p/e ratios. Just chose that emtric for testing.
